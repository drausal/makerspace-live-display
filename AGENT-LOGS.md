## Frontend Agent Status Update - TVDisplay Component Created

### 🎯 Main Achievement: Core TVDisplay Component Completed

I have successfully created the main **TVDisplay** React component that serves as the primary 24/7 TV interface for the HQ Makerspace. Here's what was accomplished:

### 📦 Components Created

1. **TVDisplay.tsx** - Main display component with:
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds 
   - Loading, error, and display states
   - Age group theming integration
   - Mock time support for testing

2. **EventCard.tsx** - Event display component with:
   - Current and upcoming event layouts
   - Time remaining/countdown displays
   - Age group badge integration
   - Accessibility features

3. **AgeGroupBadge.tsx** - Age group indicator component
4. **StatusBanner.tsx** - System status display component  
5. **Clock.tsx** - Live time display with mock time support
6. **ErrorBoundary.tsx** - Error handling wrapper component
7. **AdminPanel.tsx** - Admin control panel for time overrides

### 🔧 Infrastructure Updates

- **Updated path mappings** in tsconfig.json for proper imports
- **Created mock libraries** for KV storage, calendar fetching, and event validation
- **Updated API routes** to work with shared TypeScript interfaces
- **Fixed interface alignment** between components and shared types

### 🎨 Theming System

The components integrate with the existing age group theme system:
- Elementary (Green) - Kids events
- Teens (Orange) - Teen events  
- Adults (Blue) - Adult events
- All Ages (Purple) - General events
- Closed (Red) - No events

### 🚧 Current Status

The frontend is ready for integration with the Functions Agent APIs. The TVDisplay component will work with mock data until the following Functions Agent endpoints are implemented:

- `/api/calendar/status` - Main display status
- `/api/admin/time-override` - Time override control  
- `/api/cron/fetch-calendar` - Calendar data fetching

### 📱 Next Steps  

When the Functions Agent implements the real APIs:
1. The mock KV storage will be replaced with real Vercel KV
2. The mock calendar fetcher will integrate with actual calendar sources
3. The event validator will use real business logic
4. All components will seamlessly transition from mock to live data

The frontend architecture is designed to work perfectly with the shared TypeScript interfaces and is ready for production deployment once the backend APIs are available.

### 🎯 Ready for Testing

The admin panel at `/admin` allows testing different time scenarios, and the main display at `/` shows the live TV interface. The system is built with accessibility, burn-in prevention, and responsive design in mind.
